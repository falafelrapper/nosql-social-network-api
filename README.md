## Welcome to the eighteenth Challenge of the UCLA Bootcamp!

In this challenge we were supposed to build the back end for a social media network. You should be able to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to our backend server using Insomnia. To start, we should follow our user story on what we want to solve:

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

## The Completed Challenge

After completing the challenge, we should now have a functioning back end server with functionality to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE items in our MongoDB database. You can view an instructional demo to this backend [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lCtxvnph5ue5My68xT8hyNktDCNrFOJe/view?usp=sharing)!
