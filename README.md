## Welcome to the eighteenth Challenge of the UCLA Bootcamp!

In this challenge we were supposed to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You should be able to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to our backend server using Insomnia. To start, we should follow our user story on what we want to solve:

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## The Completed Challenge

After completing the challenge, we should now have a functioning back end server with functionality to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE items in our SQL database. You can view an instructional demo to this backend [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mru9lItz3Z5eN29efBvXF0iiOpU978SJ/view?usp=sharing)!
